   <h3> Ingredients List: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Meat </li>
        <li> Carrot </li>
        <li> Onion </li>
        <li> shugar </li>
        <li> Salt </li>
        <li> Rice </li>
        <li> Cumin seed </li>
        <li> Oil </li>
        <li> Char masala </li>
        <li> Water </li>
        <li> raisin </li>
        <li> Garlic </li>
   </ul>
<h3> Instruction Of Cook: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Rinse your rice and let the rice soak. </li>
        <li> we are going to prepare the meat. break out your instapot, pressure cooker, or regular pot. Add your oil and heat.  Add your onions. Add your roughly cut garlic. Cook for 30 seconds and then add cumin. </li>
        <li> we will add our meat. Then add a tablespoon of salt. Finally, add 3 Cups of water. I cook in my instapot for 25 minutes on high pressure. If you cook in a regular pot it will probably take about an hour. You want the meat to be fork tender. </li>
        <li> While your meat is cooking, next cook your carrots and raisins.</li>
        <li> Boil a large pot of salted water. Take your rice that you have rinsed and soaked and add to the boiling water. This is a step you have to watch. I can not give you an exact amount of time to cook the rice. But, you are only partially cooking your rice. </li>
        <li> Next, we are going to make our sugar solution to add a caramel color to our rice. In a pan add quarter cup of vegetable oil. Add your sugar. Let the sugar darken. Add 1/2 Cup of water, set aside. </li>
        <li> Take your meat out of the broth when done cooking. Now it is time to assemble everything. Take a big pot and add half of your rice to the bottom. Then, add your meat. Then add last of the rice. after that, use a few scoops of the meat broth, add the sugar mixture, and char masala.</li>
        <li> Poke some holes in the rice with the handle of a spoon. This will allow steam to release better. Take your packet of raisins and carrots and place in pan on top of your rice. I cover mine with more foil then put lid on rice.</li>
        <li> Cook on stove top on medium-low heat for about 25 minutes.</li>

    <li> Add the green onion, cilantro, chili pepper, and spices to the bowl as well. Use a fork or potato masher to mash everything. It's okay if a few lumps remain. </li>
    <li> Use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a thin circle about 20 - 22 cm in diameter, about as thin as a tortilla. The thinner the better, but not too thin that it will rip if handled. </li>
    <li> Fold the dough in half, over the filling, to create a half-moon shape. and potatoes and vegetables put it and press out all the air bubbles, then pinch the edges with your fingers to fully seal the bolani. </li>
    <li> Add a bit of the oil to a large pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the bolani to the pan. Cook for 2 - 3 minutes. Meanwhile, use a silicone pastry brush to brush some more oil on top of the bolani </li>
    <li> When the bottom is golden, flip, and let cook on the other side until golden. Then transfer to a cooling rack. Continue with the remaining bolani. </li>
    <li> Cut the bolani in triangles and serve with green chutney. Enjoy! </li>

    <h3> Ingredients List: </h3>
       <ul>
        <li> Shelled and peeled nuts. I used walnuts, pistachios, and almonds. </li>
        <li> Dried fruits. I used two different kinds of raisins, cherries, and apricots. </li>
        <li> Rose water. You could swap this for pure vanilla extract. </li>
        <li> Filtered water. </li>

            <li> First, make sure that your nuts are peeled. Don't skip this step. </li>
            <li> To peel the nuts: in a large pot, bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Remove from heat and add the walnuts and pistachios. Let sit until water is slightly cool, about 15 minutes, and add almonds. Let sit for about another 15 minutes, or until water is luke warm.

    <h2> Kimak Tea </h2>
    <img src="q.jpeg" width="400" height="300" alt=" qaimaq chai pic"> <img src="ch.jpeg" width="400" height="300" halt=" No pic">
    <h3> Ingredients List: </h3>
       <ul>
        <li> Whole milk </li>
        <li> Heavy cream </li>
        <li> Water </li>
        <li> Green tea </li>
        <li> Baking soda </li>
        <li> Ice cubes </li>
        <li> Sugar </li>
        <li> Milk </li>
        <li> Cardamom </li>
       </ul>
    <h3> Directions: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Add milk and heavy cream to large heavy-duty sauce pan. Let come to a boil. Aerate it while it comes to a boil. </li>
            <li> Allow to cook for 2-3 hours on medium low. Watch the video to get an idea of what it will look like. The cream will separate from the liquid. Then, scrape off and place into container. You will likely be able to do this 2-3 times. Each time will be 2-3 hours. I suggest reading a book or do some chores. Later, you make the tea base. </li>
            <li> Start your tea by adding your water and green tea to pot and bring to a boil. You will want your baking soda ready. While your tea is boiling, make sure you have another pot of equal, actually greater size, so you can strain the tea into it. After that you will be using the two pots to toss the tea between. </li>
            <li> Your tea as it boils will get a little foam on top, it will be white. But eventually, you want the tea to get a slight pink tint. Boil tea for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li> Add your baking soda to the tea. Be ready to aerate quickly, you will get an exciting fizz. After a few minutes this is when you will get the pinkish bubbles. Once it gets pink, or slightly red, you will add your ice cubes to stop the process. </li>
            <li> Your next step is straining the tea, and then aerating it. Do not wear a white sweater. Put some workout music on. Strain the tea. Once strained, pour the tea back and forth to aerate between the two pots for about 10 minutes. </li>
            <li> Now the fun part. You will add enough milk to get the beautiful pink color. It will magically turn pink. Warm up the chai as it will cool from adding the milk. Add your sugar to taste. Keep tasting until you like it. </li>
            <li> Add your cardamom next. </li>
            <li> Now time to serve. Take about 2 tablespoons of your Qaimaq (clotted cream). </li>

    <h3> Ingredients List: </h3>
       <ul>
        <li> Green tea </li>
        <li> Green cardamom </li>
        <li> Saffron </li>
        <li>  water </li>
       </ul>
    <h3> Directions: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Pour 4 cups of water into a kettle and bring to a boil. It is important to use fresh cold water. Using filtered water is best. </li>
            <li> Add the green tea, cardamom pods, and saffron threats to your tea infuser. I am using a teapot with infuser; however, you can make this tea directly in a pot, in a thermos, or in a kettle. The infuser is a great tool, it allows for the leaves to expand and the flavor of the spices to release into the pot. If you are not using the infuser, you would need to strain tea when serving in cups. Also, it is important to use good quality tea when brewing loose leaf. </li>
            <li> Place the infuser in the teapot and add hot water. </li>
            <li> Close the lid and allow tea to brew for 10 minutes. I leave the infuser while I server my tea. You can remove the infuser at this point if you would like. </li>
            <li> Carefully pour, serve and enjoy! </li>
